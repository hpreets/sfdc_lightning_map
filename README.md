# My recipe of Salesforce Lightning Component (LWC)

Here are few components that I created as part of my learning.

- [person-on-map](https://github.com/hpreets/sfdc_lightning_map/tree/master/force-app/main/default/lwc/personOnMap/): Show location of an address on Google map. Fetches data from Account / Contact / Any standard object / custom object to display location based on either the standard fields or latitude/longitude fields.
- [subscribe-me](https://github.com/hpreets/sfdc_lightning_map/tree/master/force-app/main/default/lwc/subscribeMe/): Uses lightning-record-form.
- [subscribe-me-v2](https://github.com/hpreets/sfdc_lightning_map/tree/master/force-app/main/default/lwc/subscribeMeV2/): Uses lightning-record-edit-form.
- [subscribe-me-v3](https://github.com/hpreets/sfdc_lightning_map/tree/master/force-app/main/default/lwc/subscribeMeV3/): Enter name and email address to subscribe. Uses lightning-input directly for more control and full functionality. This component also has jest test scripts implemented.
